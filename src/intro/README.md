# Intro

Building working, successful, and long-lasting code is hard. Moving requirements and new features basically make every year a surgical process, carefully transposing what code warks and cutting off what doesn't. Fortunately for FTC programmers, libraries are here to provide some stability and a more reasonable starting point.

This tutorial teaches two libraries together: The Qualcomm framework that all FTC teams are *required* to use, and the ElectronVolts library written by Team 7393, a step above the Qualcomm framework. However, this tutorial leans heavily into the ElectronVolts library, so if you don't want to use that, this tutorial isn't for you.

This book is *not* meant to teach how to do text-based programming. It also isn't meant to be a primer on how to use the robot apps; that can be found on the FTC [github wiki](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki). Basically, if you don't know any, you should go study up on Java. Alternatively, if you've already know a curly-brace/c-like language, then it might work out for you to just wing it.
