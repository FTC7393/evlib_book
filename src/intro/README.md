# Intro

Building working, successful, and long-lasting code is extremely hard. Constantly changing requirements and features basically make every year a surgical process, carefully transposing what code warks and cutting off that which doesn't. Fortunately for FTC programmers, the ElectronVolts library is here to provide some stability and a more reasonable starting point.

This tutorial teaches two different libraries together: The Qualcomm provided framework, and the library used by Team 7393 (which exists itself on top of the Qualcomm library). However, this tutorial leans heavily into the ElectronVolts library, so if you're not not comfortable with that (you want to start from scratch, etc.), this tutorial isn't for you.

This book is *not* meant to teach how to do text-based programming. It also isn't meant to be a primer on how to use the robot apps; that can be found on the FTC [github wiki](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki). It is only meant to teach these libraries. Basically, if you don't know any, you should go study up on Java. Alternatively, if you've already know a curly brace/c-like language, then it might work out for you to just wing it.
