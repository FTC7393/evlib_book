# Intro

Building FTC code has been, in my experience, a huge pain. Fortunately, you don't have to build it all yourself. A large source of difficulty in writing code is repetition (think functions with 10 parameters that you have to call fifty times).

This tutorial teaches two different libraries together: The Qualcomm provided framework, and the frontend used by Team 7393 (which exists itself on top of the Qualcomm library). It is intended for those who don't want to be limited by block-based programming anymore, or are just getting started.

**Keep in mind**, this book is not meant to teach how to do text-based programming. It is meant to teach these libraries. Basically, you should go study up on programming java.
