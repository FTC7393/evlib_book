# The ElectronVolts Library

## What it is:

- A tool to make writing FTC code faster
- A collection of classes containing boilerplate code
- Stable
- What this book is trying to get you to use

## What it isn't:

- Magic
- Required

The ElectronVolts library contains a lot of helpful stuff, but only if it is used correctly. It's a layer of abstraction on top of the Qualcomm framework, allowing you to write your code in a stable way.

However, learning *yet another* layer of abstraction is pretty difficult, and if the FTC library suits your purposes, it's what you should stick with. But if you struggle with these problems:

- Value fudging
- Untraceable logic
- Not knowing what's going on
- Insanity

TODO: Add concrete example of a problem

Maybe this library is a good fit for you. If it isn't, then you might want to stop here and read the FTC provided documentation instead.
