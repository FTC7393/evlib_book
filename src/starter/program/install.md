# Compile and Install

![Android Studio buttons](./install_buttons.png)

When using Android Studio normally, the box highlighted here will look like this. The hammer icon on the left is the "build" button - it compiles the code you've written using a tool called Gradle. The play button on the right triggers a "deploy" - it compiles your code, but also copies the compiled code into the robot, if it's connected by USB.

To download your code onto the REV robotics core, you must first have a USB connection between the core and the computer.
